Building the oZone project with cmake
-------------------------------------

cmake is the recommended way to build the oZone project. Autotools will be removed at some future time.

How To Build
------------
The build steps, in their simplest form, should look familar:

cmake .
make
sudo make install

Configuration
-------------
cmake by default does not require any parameters, but it is possible to override the defaults with the options below.

Configuration can be done in 2 ways:
1) As a command line parameter, e.g. cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON .
2) Using cmake-gui

NOTE: Many of these configuration options are not yet implented.

Possible configuration options: 
	OZ_RUNDIR		Location of transient process files, default: /var/run/zm
	OZ_TMPDIR		Location of temporary files, default: /tmp/zm
	OZ_LOGDIR 		Location of generated log files, default: /var/log/zm
	OZ_WEB_DIR		Location of the web files, default: <prefix>/share/zoneminder/www
	OZ_CGI_DIR		Location of the cgi-bin files, default: <prefix>/libexec/zoneminder/cgi-bin
	OZ_DB_HOST		Hostname where ZoneMinder database located, default: localhost
	OZ_DB_NAME		Name of ZoneMinder database, default: zm
	OZ_DB_USER		Name of ZoneMinder database user, default: zmuser
	OZ_DB_PASS		Password of ZoneMinder database user, default: zmpass
Advanced:
	OZ_EXTRA_LIBS		A list of optional libraries, separated by semicolons, e.g. ssl;theora
	OZ_MYSQL_ENGINE		MySQL engine to use with database, default: InnoDB
        OZ_CONFIG_DIR           Location of oZone configuration, default system config directory
        OZ_LIBARCH              Architecture specific library path, default lib, try lib64 on 64 bit systems

Useful configuration options provided by cmake:
CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE - Set this to ON (default OFF) to see what cmake is doing. Very useful for troubleshooting.
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - Set this to Debug (default Release) to build ZoneMinder with debugging enabled.
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX - Use this to change the prefix (default /usr/local). This option behaves like --prefix from autoconf. Package maintainers will probably want to set this to "/usr".

Useful environment variables provided by cmake:
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH - Use this to add to the include search path.
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH - Use this to add to the library search path.
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH - Use this to add to both include and library search paths. <path>/include will be added to the include search path and <path>/lib to the library search path. Multiple paths can be specified, separated by a : character. For example: export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/libjpeg-turbo:/opt/ffmpeg-from-git"

CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and other environment variables:
To append to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, please use the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables.
Or use the CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS configuration options.
To replace the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS entirely:
*   For the Release build type: use CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE for the CFLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE for the CXXFLAGS
*   For the Debug build type: use CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG for the CFLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG for the CXXFLAGS
Other important environment variables (such as LDFLAGS) are also supported.

The DESTDIR environment variable is also supported, however it needs to be set before invoking make install. For example: DESTDIR=mydestdir make install
For more information about DESTDIR, see:

Common Mistakes
---------------

* Cmake caches its settings in a file called "CmakeCache.txt". 
  Gererally you want to delete this file before attemping another build operation.
  Otherwsie cmake reuses those cached settings instead of checking your envronment again.
* Don't forget the trailing dot "." after the cmake command. You will strange results if it is missing.
* When setting DESTDIR, export DESTDIR as an environment variable rather than a cmake parameter.
  Setting this incorrectly will cause unredictable results.

  For example, do NOT do this:

  cmake . && make && sudo make install DESTDIR/tmp

  Instead, do this:

  export DESTDIR=/path/to/destdir
  cmake . && make && sudo make install
