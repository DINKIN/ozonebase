oZonebase cmake superbuild
--------------------------

The purpose of this superbuild is to configure, build, and install multiple
projects, currently ozonbase and its ffmpeg dependency, from a single command.
In the future, we may a client framework to the superbuild.

This is intended to make it easier for developers to build ozonebase and its
dependencies in the correct way.

If, instead, you simply need to install the ozonebase library, and nothing
more, then head over to the server subfolder and follow the cmake instructions there.

How To Build
------------
The build steps, in their simplest form, should look familar:

cmake .
make
sudo make install

NOTE: When the "make" command is given, the superbuild process will build *and*
install all the projects in the superbuild into a temporary buildroot folder.
Do not be alarmed. This is by design and is necessary. As you may expect,
issuing a "sudo make install" will transfer the contents of the buildroot
staging folder onto the filesystem as you may expect.

Configuration
-------------
cmake by default does not require any parameters, but it is possible to override the defaults with the options below.

Configuration can be done in 2 ways:
1) As a command line parameter, e.g. cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON .
2) Using cmake-gui

Possible configuration options: 
	OZ_EXAMPLES		Build the oZonebase example binaries, default: OFF
