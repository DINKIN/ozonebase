oZone is a powerful, yet simple to use framework for developers looking to create their own NVR system. 

oZone vs. ZoneMinder
*********************
Given that oZone is written and maintained by the same folks who authored ZoneMinder, its natural to wonder what the difference is.

ZoneMinder is a full featured NVR system, written several years ago. It works well. However, its an application written using technology stacks and choices that were relevant several years ago. Its hard to extend but serves its purpose well.

oZone is a *framework* not a full fledged application. It is a complete rewrite and is meant for developers to create their own version of ZoneMinder and choose how simple or how complex to make it.

oZone also has a completely different architecture which makes it *very easy* to extend and create plugins.  oZone also easily scales up or down. It can be embedded directly into a camera or serve as a platform for a massively scalable cloud system.

In short, completely different objectives.

That being said, lets get into how oZone is architected and how it may help.
