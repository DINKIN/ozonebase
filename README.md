# ZoneMinder-v2 base - headless library

This is the next generation of ZoneMinder. Completely re-written and more modern in architecture. While [Version 1](https://github.com/zoneminder) is still used by many, we felt its time to take a fresh approach as a lot of the code is legacy and hard to extend, not to mention that over the last 10 years, technology has evolved significantly.


## What is the goal?

ZoneMinder v2 headless library is a more modern take and has been re-architected to serve as a UI-less headless library. Our hope is that this will form the base of many security solutions - developers can use this library to accelerate their own vision of security software. Over time, we will also offer our own fully running UI enabled version running over NodeJS/Angular.

## Intended audience

We expect OEMs, ISVs and 3rd party developers to use this library to build their own solutons powered by us. It is not an end consumer product, unlike V1.

As of today, there is no roadmap to merge this with version 1. Version 1 has a seperate goal from Version 2 and we think its best to leave it that way for now.

## Who is developing and maintaining v2?
ZoneMinder-v2 base is developed by [Philip Coombes](https://github.com/web2wire), the original developer of ZoneMinder.
The codebase will be maintained by Phil and [Pliable Pixels](https://github.com/pliablepixels) and other key contributors who will be added soon.

ZoneMinder-v2 base library is part of a solution suite being developed by [Ozone Network](http://ozone.network). The full solution suite will eventually include a server framework (this code), a mobile framework for white-labelled apps and a reference solution using them.

Zoneminder-v2 is dual-licensed.
